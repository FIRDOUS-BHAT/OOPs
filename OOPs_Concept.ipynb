    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several compelling advantages that make it a preferred programming paradigm. One of the most significant benefits is code reusability through inheritance. In OOP, classes can inherit attributes and behaviors (methods) from existing classes, allowing developers to create new functionality without rewriting existing code. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient code.\n",
